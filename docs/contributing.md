# Contributing

First of all, thanks for choosing to contribute to Cascade. We appriciate all the help we get.

## Running locally

To get this service running locally, you can read the development guide at `/docs/development.md`.

## Git usage

To get started writing a new feature or a fix. We require branching of an existing branch.
If you need to hotfix production, you can branch of `main`. For anything else please branch of `dev`.

Never push directly to `dev` or `main`. You have to make a pull request (PR) into the branch you need.
If you do not have direct write access, make a fork and work on a new branch in your fork, then PR back into the main repo.

## code style

We implore contributers to write their best code, easily understandable is the goal.
On top of that we have a linter setup on every PR. To run this linter locally, run `npm run lint:fix` (or `npm run lint` if you don't want it to fix automatically).

## what to work on?

Wanna help but don't know what to do? You can check github issues on this repository.
Most issues that are open we'd love to be helped with.
